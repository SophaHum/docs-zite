# Installation

This guide will help you set up a new documentation website using Next.js and MDX.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 16.8.0 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm for package management

## Creating a New Project

The easiest way to get started is with the Next.js CLI which sets up everything automatically for you:

```bash
# Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript
npx create-next-app@latest my-docs --typescript

# Change to the new directory
cd my-docs
```

## Manual Setup

To manually set up a Next.js project with MDX support, follow these steps:

```bash
# Create an empty directory and initialize npm
mkdir my-docs
cd my-docs
npm init -y

# Install Next.js, React, and React DOM
npm install next react react-dom

# Install dependencies for MDX
npm install next-mdx-remote gray-matter rehype-slug rehype-autolink-headings
```

Then, update your `package.json` file to include the Next.js scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint"
}
```

## Development Server

After setting up your project, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`. You can now begin creating your documentation site.
