# Introduction

Welcome to the Next.js documentation site. This site is built with Next.js and MDX, providing a beautiful and interactive documentation experience.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality like server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. It makes building production-ready React applications straightforward with built-in features.

### Key Features

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on the server for improved SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time for maximum performance
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints within your Next.js application
- **File-system Routing**: Create routes based on the file structure of your pages directory

## Getting Started

To start using Next.js, you need to install it in your project:

```bash
# Create a new Next.js app
npx create-next-app my-next-app
# OR with TypeScript
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
