# Code Highlighting

Code blocks in MDX files are automatically syntax highlighted for better readability.

## Syntax Highlighting

This documentation site uses rehype-pretty-code for syntax highlighting. It provides beautiful, accessible code highlighting with theme support.

You can create syntax-highlighted code blocks using triple backticks followed by the language:

````md
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
````

Which will render as:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Supported Languages

The syntax highlighting supports a wide range of programming languages, including but not limited to:

- JavaScript (js)
- TypeScript (ts)
- JSX (jsx)
- TSX (tsx)
- CSS (css)
- HTML (html)
- JSON (json)
- Markdown (md)
- Bash (bash)
- Python (py)
- Ruby (rb)
- And many more...

## Code Block Features

- **Syntax highlighting**: Language-aware syntax highlighting
- **Line numbers**: Optional line numbers for easier reference
- **Copy button**: One-click copying of code blocks

## Custom Themes
