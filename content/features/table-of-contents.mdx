# Table of Contents

The documentation site includes a Table of Contents (ToC) feature to help users navigate through long pages.

## How It Works

The Table of Contents is automatically generated from the headings in your MDX content. It extracts all headings (h2, h3, and h4) and creates a navigable list of links.

## Implementation

The ToC component uses IntersectionObserver to track which headings are currently visible in the viewport, and highlights the corresponding ToC item.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the ToC component by modifying the following aspects:

### Styling

The ToC uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. You can modify the styles in the ToC component:

```tsx
// components/toc.tsx
export function TableOfContents({ toc }: TableOfContentsProps) {
  // Component code
}
```

### Depth

By default, the ToC includes headings of levels 2, 3, and 4. You can modify this behavior in the extraction function:

```tsx
// Customize which heading levels to include
const headings = toc.filter((item) => item.level >= 2 && item.level <= 4);
```

## Best Practices

When writing documentation that will use the ToC:

- Use headings in a hierarchical manner (h1 → h2 → h3 → h4)
- Keep heading text concise to avoid ToC overflow
- Use unique heading text to ensure proper linking
- Aim for a balanced structure with 3-7 main sections (h2)

## Mobile Display

On small screens, the ToC is hidden by default to preserve screen space. Users can access it via a "On this page" dropdown menu.
