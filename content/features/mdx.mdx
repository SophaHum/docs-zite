# MDX

MDX is a powerful way to write content with embedded React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that combines Markdown with JSX. It allows you to use React components within your markdown content, giving you the expressive power of React with the simplicity of markdown.

<Callout type="info">
  MDX is a superset of markdown, so any valid markdown is also valid MDX.
</Callout>

## Syntax Example

Here's a basic example of MDX syntax:

```mdx
# Hello World

This is a paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*.

<Button>Click me</Button>

## Subheading

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3
```

As you can see, you can mix Markdown syntax with React components seamlessly.

## Using Components

One of the most powerful features of MDX is the ability to use custom React components within your markdown files. For example:

```mdx
# Using Components

<Callout type="info">
  This is an informational callout that uses a custom component.
</Callout>

You can also use interactive components:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">
    ```js
    function hello() {
      console.log("Hello world!");
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    function hello(): void {
      console.log("Hello world!");
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Built-in Components

This documentation site comes with several built-in components that you can use in your MDX files:

- **Callout**: For important messages or notes
- **Tabs**: For creating tabbed interfaces
- **Steps**: For step-by-step guides
- **CodeBlock**: Enhanced code blocks with syntax highlighting and copy button
